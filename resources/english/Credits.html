This is still a very preliminary, barebones
implementation of a Remember the Milk application using Cocoa, written
in Common Lisp (Clozure CL).   It has improved some over time, and
will hopefully continue to do so. This application has no affiliation
to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>, nor it is not endorsed/supported by their team. Use at
your own risk (admitedly, it's almost none...)
